# VR and the Future of Storytelling
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e8b6ecbd-b98a-4ee9-ace3-49fd6442d276.jpg)

I grew up on William Gibson's _Neuromancer _and the original _Tron_. Back in the 80s, when people were barely getting to grips with the keyboard, mouse and monochrome cathode ray tube, it somehow seemed inevitable to me that virtual reality would soon become the predominant human-computer interface.

Our expectations were so much lower back then, in terms of computer graphics and hardware performance, but it turned out that _acceptable _virtual reality was out of reach. The headsets were huge, the field of view tiny and a combination of factors including the latency involved in head tracking and the low refresh rate in rendering, meant that motion sickness was almost inevitable. As technology has advanced, our expectations have grown in parallel. The goalposts have kept moving and acceptable VR has remained elusive, just ahead of the curve and out of reach. We've only now finally crossed the technology/expectation threshold at which VR display technology can be considered _acceptable_. We can achieve sufficiently high resolutions and refresh rates, with sufficiently low latency, in a sufficiently small headset, at a sufficiently low price point.

But this is just the beginning. In the same way that the earliest portable computers are the distant ancestors of the smartphones and tablets that are ubiquitous and indispensable today, so the coming crop of consumer VR/AR headsets are the first incarnation of a new category of device that will culminate in completely transparent, immersive, interactive technology. We have no idea what those devices will ultimately look like, but expect them to be more akin to the _Star Trek holodeck _or the _Matrix headjack _than any of the wearable devices we foresee today.

When the film camera was invented, the Lumière brothers were among the first to try and adapt the narrative conventions of theatre to the new medium. But it took the genius of Georges Méliès to recognize that film didn't have to be constrained by those old conventions. 120 years later, the sophisticated storytelling of cinema has diverged so far from its predecessor that the relationship is barely evident.

So when _Pixar _co-founder Ed Catmull said of VR "it's good, but it's not storytelling," I believe he was missing the point. In the same _Guardian _interview he repeatedly used the phrase "linear narrative", explaining it as "an artfully-directed telling of a story, where the lighting and the sound is all for a very clear purpose." But it is exactly the potential for non-linear narrative that makes virtual reality so exciting. There is nothing preventing a non-linear narrative from being as artfully-directed as a linear one, except the imagination of the storyteller.

Video games are currently the primary medium for non-linear narrative and while the quality of storytelling in games has advanced enormously in recent years, story is always secondary to gameplay. The VR films I want to make are stories first and foremost. Crafted and nuanced, branching narratives to be explored and experienced again and again. Imagine a live incarnation of a _Choose Your Own Adventure _story, where you get to be the protagonist, interacting with other characters and where your actions affect the story as it unfolds. 

Non-linearity is not the only unique characteristic of VR storytelling. The first and most obvious way in which VR experiences differ from film and television is by transcending the confines of the rectangular screen and opening up a full 360 degree field of view. That one change immediately makes much of the visual language of film obsolete. This is what Ed Catmull was referring to when he spoke of "the lighting and the sound ... all for a very clear purpose." The set of film-making conventions that encourage viewers to look at the right part of the screen at the right time in order to convey a story point or evoke an emotional response, have no counterparts in 360 degree immersive storytelling. But I for one am hoping to tell stories that take advantage of that new freedom, rather than ones that require us to replicate the old limitations.

In real life there is never just one version of a story and indeed there is never just one story. Over the years, various filmmakers have experimented with weaving multiple inter-connected stories together or addressing the starkly different possible interpretations of the same events as seen from different perspectives. But even in such landmark examples as _Interstellar_ and _Pulp Fiction_, the way the story unfolds on screen is still bound by the limitations of the feature film format; scene-by-scene, frame-by-frame, every time the same.

VR will allow this limitation, too, to be transcended. Perhaps you'll watch the same story multiple times, but through the eyes of each character in turn, getting different insights into each character's motives and personal story, as in the _Perspective _series of VR shorts by Rose Troche and Morris May. Or maybe you'll be able to change the order in which different events take place.

Film is very much a passive medium in which the filmmakers are responsible for providing the audience with all the pieces of the puzzle and furthermore, are often expected to solve it for them. By contrast, VR opens up the possibility of a more participatory form of storytelling. You can imagine stories where even the degree to which hidden aspects of the story get revealed can vary from one viewer to another - from one viewing to another. How much more compelling would _Sherlock Holmes _be, if it were customizable to each person's level of engagement and deductive abilities?

Writer/Director Mike Judge exhibited uncanny foresight in his dystopian satire _Idiocracy_, which featured a popular TV show called _Ow, My Balls._The fetishistic schadenfreude of that imaginary show wouldn't be at all out of place among the fail video channels on YouTube today. What Judge was railing against was the short attention spans and unsophisticated tastes of the ADHD generation. But these are as much symptoms of un-engaging content as they are of inattentive audiences. Seven-second _Vines _and 140 character _tweets_ represent the epitome of short attention span media. Yet, at the same time, huge audiences binge-watch entire seasons of well-crafted TV series on _Netflix_.

VR has the ability to engage audiences to a degree that has never before been possible. Ultimately we will be able to create synthetic experiences that are indistinguishable from reality. For now that goal is a long way off, but we have identified most of the challenges involved and many of their respective solutions. As the visual and audio quality continue to improve, as head/body tracking and user input become seamless, as the various cues that unconsciously tip us off to a VR experience being artificial are resolved and as our other senses are recruited, one-by-one into the illusion, so that goal draws closer. But we can already start to see the benefits that the current, comparatively primitive, technology confers.

Provided the refresh rate is high enough and the tracking latency low enough, we are able to suspend our disbelief in even the most crudely rendered virtual world. We can recognize and relate to the movements of another human being applied to even the most primitive computer generated object.

For many years, researchers at Stanford University's Virtual Human Interaction Lab and the University of Southern California's Institute of Creative Technology have experimented with VR as a tool for cultivating empathy in audiences. By experiencing the plight of others, first-hand, by being able to virtually walk a mile in another's shoes, viewers have been shown to experience greater empathy and engagement. VR filmmakers like Chris Milk and Nonny de la Peña have built on this research and it demonstrably informs their storytelling.

Because the real purpose of storytelling isn't to entertain. It's true that stories have always been more likely to achieve their purpose if they are entertaining, but if you think about it, stories were the first man-made technology for storing and sharing information. Even as the technology of storytelling evolves, stories continue to serve that purpose; encapsulating knowledge and wisdom in an engaging form and challenging audiences to think for themselves.
